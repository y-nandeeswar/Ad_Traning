# Task 1

# Ask the user to enter a positive integer n
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer n: "))

# 1. Use a for loop to print all numbers from 1 to n on separate lines
print("\nUsing for loop to print numbers from 1 to", n)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(i)

# 2. Use a while loop to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n
sum_numbers = 0
i = 1  # Initialize a variable to use in the while loop
while i <= n:
    sum_numbers += i  # Add the current number to the sum
    i += 1  # Increment the counter

# Print the sum
print("\nThe sum of all numbers from 1 to", n, "is:", sum_numbers)
